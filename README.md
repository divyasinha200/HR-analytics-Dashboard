## 👩‍💼 Business Analyst Role

### 🧩 Business Problem

The HR department lacked visibility into *why employees were leaving the organization* and which *factors were contributing to attrition* across departments, age groups, and education levels. There was no central dashboard to track *attrition rate, **work-life balance, and **job satisfaction* metrics, which limited HR’s ability to create effective employee retention strategies.

### 💡 My Role as a Business Analyst

As a Business Analyst, I:

- Defined critical KPIs:
  - Attrition Rate

  - Work-Life Balance
  - Job Satisfaction

- Helped HR stakeholders explore:

  - Age-wise and gender-based attrition risks
  - Trends by education and job roles

- Delivered actionable recommendations to reduce attrition
